# PythonStreamdeck
A customizable streamdeck using the numbad, for people who don't want to buy one

## Usage
**Please read this before using**
There are 10 keys you can customise. In the program there you will find something that looks like
key_1 = []
In that array you want to put the keypresses you want it to trigger
e.g. for muting in Discord: key_1 = ["lctrl", "lshift", "m"]
